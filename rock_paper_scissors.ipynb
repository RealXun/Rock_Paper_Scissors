    "- Import the choice function from the random module\n",
    "- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-to-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list\n",
    "- Assign the 3 possible options to a list: 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.\n",
    "- Assign a variable to the maximum number of games: 1, 3, 5, etc...\n",
    "- Assign a variable to the number of games a player must win to win.\n",
    "- Preferably the value will be based on the number of maximum games\n",
    "- Define a function that randomly returns one of the 3 options.\n",
    "- This will correspond to the play of the machine. Totally random.\n",
    "- Define a function that asks for your choice: 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' should only allow one of the 3 options. This is defensive programming. If it's not rock, paper, scissors, keep asking until it is.\n",
    "- Define a function that resolves a combat.\n",
    "- Returns 0 if there is a tie, 1 if the machine wins, 2 if the human player wins\n",
    "- Define a function that shows the choice of each player and the state of the game\n",
    "- This function must be used every time the accumulated points are updated\n",
    "- Create two variables that accumulate the games won by each participant\n",
    "- Create a loop that iterates as long as no player reaches the minimum number of wins needed to win. Inside the loop it resolves the machine's move and asks the player's. Compare them and update the value of the variables that accumulate the games won by each participant.\n",
    "- Announce by console the winner of the game based on who has the most accumulated victories"
